#instll package arules
library(arules)
library(datasets)
library(arulesViz)

#if the dataset is in the form transaction id+items
MarkBask_Sample =read.csv("F:/Praxis/S03/R_Codes/DataSets/RetailData_Sample.csv")
View(MarkBask_Sample)
MarkBask_Modified <- split(MarkBask_Sample$Item, MarkBask_Sample$TransID)
transactions =as(MarkBask_Modified, "transactions")


# Load the preloaded data set
data(Groceries)
class(Groceries) #[1] "transactions" attr(,"package") [1] "arules"


#if csv is directly available
transactions1= read.csv("F:/Praxis/S03/R_Codes/DataSets/groceries.csv")
#View(transactions1)
data(transactions1)
class(transactions1) #dataframe => has to convert to arules/transactions form
transactions1 =as(transactions1, "transactions")


#generating rules
rules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8,maxlen=3))
rules <- apriori(transactions1, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8,target='rules',maxlen=3))
#minimum support to 0.001 & minimum confidence of 0.8 & we just need 3 products to bundle



##Removing redundancies
subset.matrix <- is.subset(rules, rules)
subset.matrix[lower.tri(subset.matrix, diag=T)] <- NA
redundant <- colSums(subset.matrix, na.rm=T) >= 1
rules.pruned <- rules[!redundant]
rules<-rules.pruned

rules<-sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE) #sort the rules by the confedence
inspect(rules[1:10])

##inspecting OUTPUT
#   lhs                                      rhs                support     confidence     lift
#1  {citrus.fruit=kitchen towels}         => {margarine=}   0.001111474          1        2.501226


#support =>fraction of transactions in our dataset that contain our itemset (citrus fruit+kitchen towels+margarine)
#confidence => likelihood that it is true for a new transaction that contains the items on the LHS of the rule. (I.e. it is the probability that the transaction also contains the item(s) on the RHS.)
#lift => 1 means LHS and RHS are independence -- gt 1 =>precense of the items on the LHS has increased the probability that the items on the right hand side will occur on this transaction.
        # lt 1 => the presence of the items on the LHS make the probability that the items on the RHS will be part of the transaction lower.


## targeting items
#What are customers likely to buy before buying margarine
rules<-apriori(data=transactions1, parameter=list(supp=0.001,conf = 0.08), 
               appearance = list(default="lhs",rhs="margarine="),
               control = list(verbose=F))
rules<-sort(rules, decreasing=TRUE,by="confidence")
